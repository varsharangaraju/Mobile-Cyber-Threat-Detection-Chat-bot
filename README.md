ðŸ’¡ How It Works
The app uses React and Axios for sending HTTP requests to the Hugging Face API.

The user's message is displayed in the chat window, and the bot's response is shown after a slight delay, simulating real-time conversation.

The loading state is displayed while waiting for the botâ€™s response.
